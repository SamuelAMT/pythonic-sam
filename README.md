# pythonic sam

A comprehensive collection of pure Python implementations and examples, focusing on core language features without external dependencies.

## About

This repository explores Python's built-in capabilities and standard library, demonstrating clean, idiomatic Python code. Rather than relying on frameworks and third-party libraries, these examples showcase what's possible with vanilla Python.

## What You'll Find

- **Core Python Concepts**: Data structures, algorithms, and design patterns
- **Standard Library Deep Dives**: Exploring Python's extensive built-in modules
